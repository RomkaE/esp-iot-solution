## Tools

### unit-test-app (Make)

To use uint-test, follow these steps:

* Change to the directory of unit-test-app

    ```
    cd YOUR_IOT_SOLUTION_PATH/tools/unit-test-app
    ```

* Use the default sdkconfig and compile unit-test-app by `make IOT_TEST_ALL=1 -j8`

    ```
    make defconfig
    make IOT_TEST_ALL=1
    ```

* Flash the images by `make flash`

    ```
    make IOT_TEST_ALL=1 flash
    ```

* Reset the chip and see the uart log using an uart tool such as minicom
* All kinds of components will be shown by uart

    ```
    Here's the test menu, pick your combo:
    (1)     "Sensor BH1750 test" [bh1750][iot][sensor]
    (2)     "Button test" [button][iot]
    (3)     "Button cpp test" [button_cpp][iot]
    (4)     "Dac audio test" [dac_audio][iot][audio]
    (5)     "Debug cmd test" [debug][iot]

### Setting up Development Environment

1. [Install ESP-IDF v4.0.1 Step By Step](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.0.1/get-started/index.html#installation-step-by-step)

>Current branch based on ESP-IDF `v4.0.1`

2. Get ESP-IoT-Solution

    ```shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-iot-solution
    ```

3. Initialize the Submodules

    ```shell
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

4. Set up the Environment Variables

    ```shell
    export IOT_SOLUTION_PATH=~/esp/esp-iot-solution
    ```

### Creating Your Project (CMake)

* We can regard IoT solution project as a platform that contains different device drivers and features
* `Add-on project`: If you want to use those drivers and build your project base on the framework, you need to include the IoT components into your project's `CMakeLists.txt`.

    ```
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)

    include($ENV{IOT_SOLUTION_PATH}/component.cmake)
    include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)

    project(empty-project)
    ```


* `Stand-alone component`: if you just want to pick one of the component and put it into your existing project, you just need to copy the single component to your project components directory. But you can also append the component list in your project's `CMakeLists.txt` like this:

    ```
    set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS "${EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS} ${IOT_SOLUTION_PATH}/components/{component_you_choose}")
    ```

### Creating Your Project (Legacy GNU Make)

* We can regard IoT solution project as a platform that contains different device drivers and features
* `Add-on project`: If you want to use those drivers and build your project base on the framework, you need to include the IoT components into your project's `Makefile`.

    ```
    include $(IOT_SOLUTION_PATH)/component.mk
    include $(IDF_PATH)/make/project.mk
    ```

* `Stand-alone component`: if you just want to pick one of the component and put it into your existing project, you just need to copy the single component to your project components directory. But you can also append the component list in your project Makefile like this:

    ```
    EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS += $(IOT_SOLUTION_PATH)/components/{component_you_choose}
    ```
