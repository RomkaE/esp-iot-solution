## Unit-test (Make)

To use uint-test, follow these steps:

* Change to the directory of unit-test-app

    ```
    cd YOUR_IOT_SOLUTION_PATH/tools/unit-test-app
    ```

* Use the default sdkconfig and compile unit-test-app by `make IOT_TEST_ALL=1 -j8`

    ```
    make defconfig
    make IOT_TEST_ALL=1
    ```

* Flash the images by `make flash`

    ```
    make IOT_TEST_ALL=1 flash
    ```

* Reset the chip and see the uart log using an uart tool such as minicom
* All kinds of components will be shown by uart

    ```
    Here's the test menu, pick your combo:
    (1)     "Sensor BH1750 test" [bh1750][iot][sensor]
    (2)     "Button test" [button][iot]
    (3)     "Button cpp test" [button_cpp][iot]
    (4)     "Dac audio test" [dac_audio][iot][audio]
    (5)     "Debug cmd test" [debug][iot]
    (6)     "Deep sleep gpio test" [deep_sleep][rtc_gpio][current][iot]
    (7)     "Deep sleep touch test" [deep_sleep][touch][current][iot]
     ......
    ```

* You need to send the index of the unit you want to test by uart. Test code of the unit you select will be run
